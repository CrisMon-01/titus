## Why is it named Titus?

The project began in 2015 as a pairing of two other projects at Netflix. We married the back end of the container execution engine Titan to the front end of the scheduling system for stream processing [Mantis](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/stream-processing-with-mantis-78af913f51a6). Titan + Mantis = Titus.
